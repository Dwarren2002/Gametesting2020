Games Myst, Skyrim, Sims 4
Skyrim is a great game because it had everything that people love about RPGs and fantasy games. It was also open world, and the world felt alive and interactive. It also let the player do almost anything you can do swoard fighting and then the next moment be casting spells. It was also a lot of peoples first RPG game and it was a great entry game. I had a chaeter creation but it wasn't huge and confusing, it had all the RPG mechnics but not huge and confusing. Overall it was fun and simiple but also deep and engaging. 
Sims 4 is the 4th interation of the hugly popular franchise. Many have complained that it isn't as good as its presisiors but it really is a good game. The sims serise is a life similation game where there are some touches of fiction. You are god and the sims is your world, or worlds,to control. The s4 introduce a lot of new things and experimented with new things and made it more open to new players just starting out in gaming. The sims has always been that game you play when you want to relax and have some dumb fun. Will Wright created a new genrea of game and the sims has always dilivered on the simulation of life and more. 
Myst is a classic game that was well past my time but due to my dads love of series, even naming my younger sister after a character, made me play and read. It was astounding at the time due to it's graphics, story, and gameplay. I was best selling till the sims came out and has produced many sequales. It lacked in stability but it engaged players to the point that they would put up with the crashes and keep playing.
